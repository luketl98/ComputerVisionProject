# ComputerVisionProject
A program that will allow the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors using just their webcam

After creating and cloning my GitHub repository and linking it to VSCode;

First I went to TeachableMachine, selected create a new image model and created four classes named 'Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissor' and 'Nothing'

I used 200-300 image samples for each class and trained the model, then I breifly tested the model using the preview funciton on the TeachableMachine website to check it was working to a sufficient standard - I'll update the model if I feel it necessary later on in the project

I exported the model and saved it locally, then added it to my GitHub repo and pulled the changes to the project folder through VSCode

Following this, I used a Model Testing File to test that the data was correctly stored and all the necessary files, packages and libraries were installed correctly and in the right place

After a quick reconfigure of the folders and installed libraries, I wrote the code that would store the users and the computers choices during the game
